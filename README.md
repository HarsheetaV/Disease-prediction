Leveraging Machine Learning tools to predict various health conditions

Support Vector Machine (SVM) for Diabetes Prediction and Parkinson's Detection:
This repository contains machine learning project that focuses on utilizing Support Vector Machine (SVM) models for two different purposes: diabetes prediction and Parkinson's disease detection. The project demonstrates the implementation of SVM models in Python, utilizing popular libraries such as scikit-learn for SVM model training and evaluation.


Project Overview
The main objectives of this project are:
Diabetes Prediction: Building an SVM model to predict whether an individual has diabetes based on various medical features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, etc.
Parkinson's Disease Detection: Developing an SVM model to detect Parkinson's disease using relevant features such as tremor measurements, vocal features, and patient demographic information.

The project covers the following key steps:
Data preprocessing, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and splitting the datasets into training and testing sets.
Evaluation of the trained SVM models using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess their predictive capabilities.
